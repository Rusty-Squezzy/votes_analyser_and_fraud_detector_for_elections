# votes_analyser_and_fraud_detector_for_elections
a script that calculates fraudsters on the ballot. This is a laboratory work on the subject "Programming Paradigms and technologies" at SFU

description of the task:
In the online voting, users chose one of the 200 contestants.
The participants have unique names, but we don't have a list of names.
But there are voting logs, according to which you need to make a final rating of participants.
The problem is that users could enter the names of the participants themselves, and sometimes they made mistakes.
It is known that no user made more than 2 typos.
There are three types of typos: skip a letter, write the wrong letter, or write two random letters instead of 1 letter.
It is known that among the participants there were two unscrupulous people who swindled the votes in various ways.
We need to find these participants.
Restore the voting results as accurately as possible.
